Introduction

Autonomous vehicles in unstructured outdoor environment need to estimate the traversability of the terrain.
"Explain the concept of traversability" - A terrain is said to be traversable if a vehicle can reach a goal point, starting from an initial position.
This thesis presents a new approach based on simulation and machine learning to predict whether a given 3D region is traversable by a simple ground robot.
The proposed approach has two main phases: the first consists of simulating a robot that traverses a 3D terrain in a virtual environment, determine 
in which areas it got stuck or capsized, and collect data from the simulations to obtain an extensive dataset of possible outcomes. 
The second phase instead aims to analyze the resulting dataset and use it to train a neural network model, whose purpose is, to judge the 
traversability of a terrain (by its 3D structure), and plan a path the robot can traverse.
By using an approach based on machine learning, thereâ€™s no need to manually define heuristic rules to predict the traversability of terrain patches; 
moreover, the approach is applicable to any type of ground robot (wheeled/legged) as long as it can be reliably simulated.

Simulation

A main assumption of this approach is that a terrain map is available at priori (e.g. 3D radar surface reconstruction).
