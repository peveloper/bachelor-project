Unmanned vehicle navigation and terrain traversability is a core topic in robotics
and in its consequent applications such as land exploration, military scouting or
reconnaissance and more general situations, thus the need for an intelligent system
to address this issue. The planned approach is to construct a robot controller,
run several simulations on virtual terrain environments, build a dataset of terrain
patches and then investigate whether to apply machine learning to automatically predict
if a given terrain is traversable or not.
